## How this branch is different
I added a feature that shows the citizens' names + the background of the map is blue!
I am still far from getting used to both github and java-which is why I don't do a pull request--

# WurmMapGen
Interactive tile map generator for Wurm Unlimited servers.

## Features
- Flexible instant search for any marker on the map
- Realtime updated player location markers (optional)
- Extensive [configuration options](https://github.com/woubuc/WurmMapGen/wiki/Configuration)

## How to use
Read the [documentation](https://github.com/woubuc/WurmMapGen/wiki)

## Master branch
When using this application in production, never directly use the code
from the master branch, as it may contain unfixed bugs or unfinished
features. Always use the downloads on the releases page.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute by fixing bugs or adding features, I welcome
pull requests.
